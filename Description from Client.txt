hello
I have Two Tables.

Service Desk is the first table
CRM is the other table



The table represents requests from customers to a group in a bank
So we need to make Data Cleaning For the tables if needed then I need a dashboard for the resolution rate, effectiveness, etc
For the four teams, across the two platforms (ie service desk and CRM)
The four teams are
ATM Support
Corporate Digital Banking
Internet and Mobile Banking Support
POS Merchant Services



Although



ATM Support doesnâ€™t work on CRM platform, For service desk
Breached passed are the cases that were not resolved early enough, For CRM
Within SLA are the cases that were resolved early
